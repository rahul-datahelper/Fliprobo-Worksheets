Q11 to Q13 are subjective questions, answer them briefly
11. Differentiate between a list, tuple, set and dictionary.

Ans: List - lists are mutable it can be changed after creation and also list cannot be used as key in dictionary because dictionary itself are immutable.	
     Tuples - tuples are immutable it cannot be changed after creation but it can be used in dictionary as tuples and dictionary both are immutable.
     Sets - A set is a collection of unique keys. it is similar to dictionary but it only holds single value not like Key:Value Pair.
     Dictionary - A dictionary is a collection of key:value pair. Eg{'A':1} it is mutable and have unordered collection. where as list and tuples are ordered
                  collection of items.




12. Are strings mutable in python? Suppose you have a string ‚ÄúI+Love+Python‚Äù, write a small code to replace ‚Äò+‚Äô with space in python.

Ans: Strings are immutable reason being their value cannot be updated.

     text="I+Love+Python"
     result=text.replace("+"," ")
     print(result)

13. What does the function ord() do in python? Explain with example. Also, write down the function for getting the datatype of a variable in python.

Ans: The ord() function returns the number representing the unicode code of a specified character.
     type() function is used to fetch the datatype of a variable.
     eg. type(a) // 'a' being any input

Q14 and Q15 are programming questions. Answer them in Jupyter Notebook.
14. Write a python program to solve a quadratic equation of the form ùëéùë•2+ùëèùë•+ùëê=0. Where a, b and c are to be taken by user input.
    Handle the erroneous input, such as ‚Äòa‚Äô should not be equal to 0.
