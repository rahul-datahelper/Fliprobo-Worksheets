The US President Donald Trump and House of Representative Democrats should end their deadlock and reach a compromise on the second economic relief package for a battered US economy, argues an editorial in the Washington Post.

“The country has already waited too long. A wide consensus among economists and business leaders recognizes that the U.S. government not only can afford to extend additional large-scale aid but cannot afford not to,” notes the editorial. “Yet Republicans and Democrats are far apart on how much money to provide. The Republican Senate put forth a $1.1 trillion proposal, after the Democratic House offered a $3.4 trillion plan.”

“Democrats insist on far more in aid to state and local governments than Republicans are willing to accept. Democrats also want to continue a $600 supplemental unemployment benefit that Republicans would renew only at a lower amount. Republicans are also resisting additional funds to help states carry out the November election safely,” it adds.
